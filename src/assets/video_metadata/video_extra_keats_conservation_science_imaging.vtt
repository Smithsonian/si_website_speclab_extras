00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.490 line:15% 
at the Smithsonian Museum's Conservation Institute:

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.730
a support center for all of the Smithsonian units,

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.910
the museum's, galleries, archives, the National Zoo

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.010
and also the other research centers.

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.920
And we're providing conservation, technical studies

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.870
and scientific research to research

8
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.423
and care for the Smithsonian collections.

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.600
As an imaging scientist, I am using a variety of techniques,

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.030
cameras, radiation sources, filters,

11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.200
different setups in order

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.180
to look at objects in different ways.

13
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.060
And so we can use these techniques to record the condition

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.300
of an object, increase our understanding of the materials,

15
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.640
the manufacturer, and also help to inform the care

16
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.070
and treatment of those objects.

17
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.660
One of the benefits of imaging

18
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.430
is that it's a non-invasive technique

19
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.920
and it's giving you a full view of the objects.

20
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.830
Some of the other scientific analytical techniques

21
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.900
require a sample, or they're point-based,

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.730
so you're only looking at a single point

23
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.780
on the entire object.

24
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.450
And imaging's giving you a non-invasive view

25
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.713
of the full object.

26
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.670
Visible light is kind of the starting point with imaging

27
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.170
'cause that's gonna give us information

28
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.000
about the color of the object.

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.490
It can give us information about the current condition

30
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.560
of the object, if there's fading,

31
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.880
different types of degradation

32
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.090
that may show up within the visible range or through color.

33
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.980
And so that's a really good starting point

34
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.110
and that's also gonna act as a reference image

35
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.840
for us when we start to look at different wave bands

36
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.600
that we might not be able to see with our eyes.

37
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.830
If we think about a very simplified structure

38
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.220
of a painting, the top layer is gonna be a varnish layer

39
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.140
that's gonna be clear to us

40
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.850
and we're gonna be able to see through it

41
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.960
and see that paint layer.

42
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.730
But that's a protective surface

43
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.640
that is on many paintings.

44
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.610
If you irradiate that painting with UV radiation,

45
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.590
we're gonna be seeing that top surface -

46
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.900
so the UV radiation doesn't go through that.

47
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.940
Reflected UV can be useful

48
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.150
for identifying past conservation treatments

49
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.320
'cause the conservation treatments

50
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.860
are gonna use different materials from the original object.

51
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.460
And because UV, the shorter wavelengths of UV

52
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.530
are not necessarily penetrating the surface

53
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.860
of the object, we're seeing that top surface of the object.

54
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.160
And so, with a painting that may be the varnish layer

55
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.603
that we're able to record.

56
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.450
UV-induced visible luminescence

57
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.590
is using a UV radiation source to radiate an object.

58
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.850
And some materials will absorb

59
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.940
that radiation and readmit it as longer wavelengths.

60
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.580
And we're able to see that as luminescence

61
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.680
or fluorescence of the object.

62
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.580
And this is particularly useful for adhesives and coatings

63
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.610
and varnishes, as those tend to luminesce.

64
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.200
And so you can see the difference

65
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.660
in how that conservation treatment shows up

66
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.680
with UV radiation in contrast to the luminescence

67
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.210
of the varnish.

68
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.060
This is a test chart that a paintings conservator made

69
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.470
to look at varnishes and resin.

70
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.000
As it is right now we see,

71
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.830
you know, yellow and orange tones.

72
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.530
We're not seeing huge differences

73
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.090
but we're seeing some variation in that.

74
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.890
But with the UV radiation,

75
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.810
it starts to show pretty large color differences.

76
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.790
And so we have a bunch of different types

77
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.340
of shellac along the bottom.

78
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.650
The characteristic luminescence of shellac

79
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.990
tends to be a bright orange,

80
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.490
which we're seeing with several of these.

81
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.740
But we also have some additional shellacs

82
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.520
that are showing purple and blue luminescence.

83
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.050
And so having this option of being able to look at an object

84
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.560
with the UV radiation source can help a conservator think

85
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.620
about what may need to be done to care for

86
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.020
or treat an object.

87
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.030
Pigments were made at different periods of time

88
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.030
and we have an understanding of when those were introduced

89
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.560
and commercially used.

90
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.340
And so having information about what pigments are

91
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.340
in an object can can help provide information

92
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.163
about when and where that object might have been made.

93
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.300
And so I'm gonna use a filter that blocks visible light

94
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.880
and passes infrared radiation.

95
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.890
So we can't see through it

96
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.083
because we can't see into the infrared.

97
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.950
Reflected infrared is used quite widely

98
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.950
for paintings conservation because there are materials

99
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.300
that will transmit infrared radiation.

100
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.850
So you're seeing past that top painted layer

101
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.290
and you can start to see earlier versions of the painting

102
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.820
or even some under drawings.

103
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.800
This is a historic paper document

104
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.410
that has three different types of ink on it.

105
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.030
So it's really interesting to look at

106
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.960
with the different wavelengths

107
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.240
'cause those inks are gonna respond differently

108
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.800
because it's a historic document.

109
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.470
It also has kind of different condition features

110
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.860
that show up differently with the different wavelengths.

111
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.420
So this is a visible light image

112
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.270
of this historic paper document.

113
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.000
We can see a red ink and a black ink

114
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.940
and then a little bit further down we see some handwriting

115
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.160
and that's in a brownish ink.

116
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.060
So this is the visible light of that handwritten piece

117
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.460
with that brownish ink,

118
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.300
we can turn on the UV induced visible luminescence image

119
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.450
and we see that that's really strongly absorbing

120
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.700
that UV radiation.

121
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.070
And then switching to the reflected infrared,

122
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.680
we see that that almost entirely disappears

123
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.453
within that infrared image.

124
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.470
And seeing that it absorbs UV radiation

125
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.900
and disappears within the infrared suggests

126
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.340
that it's iron gall ink,

127
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.370
which would be kind of used during that time.

128
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.380
And we know that those are the characteristics

129
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.240
of that particular ink

130
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.730
that's different from the printed black ink

131
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.570
that's still visible within the reflected infrared image.

132
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.370
We're seeing that those are different inks.

133
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.400
There would need to be additional analysis to confirm

134
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.350
that that is an iron gall ink.

135
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.140
Imaging is a really good option

136
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.750
for starting an investigation for

137
00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.430
of an object to learn more about it.

138
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.210
It is non-destructive and it also offers this overall view

139
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.320
and that can be really important

140
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.990
for informing the conservation of the object,

141
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.470
but also informing additional scientific analysis

142
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.450
and additional study of the object.

143
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.900
It can be used for identifying areas

144
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.570
where you might wanna do point-based analysis

145
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.870
or even take samples that will help build up

146
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.510
that kind of multi-analytical approach

147
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.700
for looking at an object.

148
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.430
There's a lot of exciting things that can be done

149
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.980
with imaging and the processing of imaging.

150
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.280
There's also an incredible opportunity to be collaborating

151
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.500
with people throughout the institution.

152
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.330
It's incredible to work with them,

153
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.500
to be able to learn from them,

154
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.596
there's just a lot of potential there.

155
00:06:42.596 --> 00:06:45.179
(upbeat music)
