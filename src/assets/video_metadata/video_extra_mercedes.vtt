<v ->My name is Mercedes López-Morales,</v>

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.190 line:15% 
and I'm an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics.

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.590 line:15% 
I study exoplanets, which are planets

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.800 line:15% 
that orbit around stars other than the sun.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.660
Right now, it is very important

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.880
to take care of our own Earth.

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.910
However, humans are curious creatures

8
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.670
and we will never stop wondering

9
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.380
if we are alone in the universe.

10
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.010
And so, in that sense, some of us

11
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.980
will have to continue searching for planets elsewhere

12
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.920
to be able to provide humanity with the answer

13
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.200
to this question that we have had for centuries

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.240
of are we alone in the universe,

15
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.520
and is there a life elsewhere?

16
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.990
As you look at other stars,

17
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.840
it turns out that pretty much every star has a planet.

18
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.820
We basically have been finding these planets

19
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.800
for almost like 30 years now.

20
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.200
And the most successful technique

21
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.630
is what we call the transit technique,

22
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.640
which basically takes advantage

23
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
of some of these planets actually crossing

24
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.520
in front of the star from our point of view.

25
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.230
So it's like a little eclipse.

26
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.430
So you know, every time the planet

27
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.110
goes in front of the star,

28
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.130
you see this little dip in the light coming from the star,

29
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.010
and that little dip is produced by a planet,

30
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.010
so you know that we have a planet there.

31
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.770
Initially, all the transiting planets

32
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.770
were discovered with very small telescopes from the ground,

33
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.770 line:15% 
for example, WASP-96B was discovered

34
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.680 line:15% 
by the Wide-Angle Search for Planets project,

35
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.190 line:15% 
which is basically a group of very, very small telescopes

36
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.640
that were monitoring the sky over and over and over,

37
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.500
looking for these little dips in, you know,

38
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.930
in the light coming from the star.

39
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.600
The advantage of small telescopes from the ground

40
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.630
is that unlike big professional telescopes,

41
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.910
you can use these telescopes all the time

42
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.300
and you can stare at stars for a very long period of time.

43
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.590
So they're really, really good

44
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.540
at finding transiting planets.

45
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.900
That was the technology that we had more than a decade ago.

46
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.900
And if you compare the original WASP-96 light curve

47
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.290
with what we can do now for that same planet with JWST,

48
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.210
you see that the original light curve

49
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.620
was really, really noisy.

50
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.950
We could barely see that 1% drop in light.

51
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.710
When now, with James Webb,

52
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.650
you can easily see like a very, very precise

53
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.880
transit light curve.

54
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.550
So, the technology has come a long way,

55
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.550
but if it hadn't been for the very small telescopes

56
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.930
on the ground initially,

57
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.360
we wouldn't be here in this field.

58
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.970
With the techniques that we have right now,

59
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.690
we still cannot detect a planet exactly like Earth,

60
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.630
that is, a planet the size of our Earth,

61
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.640
around a star like the sun,

62
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.620
or within in a one-year period.

63
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.420
Our technology doesn't allow us to do that just yet.

64
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.820
However, with the technology that we have,

65
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.990
we have found over 6,000 planets right now

66
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.430
that all of them are much closer to their host stars.

67
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.735
You know, we are talking about planets

68
00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:02.080
that go around the stars

69
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.440
on periods of about like from three days to about 100 days.

70
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.810
And for those type of planets,

71
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.970
we have seen pretty much everything.

72
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.220
We have seen planets the size of Jupiter,

73
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.980
Saturn, Neptune, you name it,

74
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.010
all the way down to Mars-size planets.

75
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.203
So these systems that we have found so far,

76
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.380
you know, in size, the planets are similar

77
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.240
to the planets in the solar system,

78
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.590
but the properties of these planets

79
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.990
are fairly different to the solar system.

80
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.690
To begin with, they're all like hotter versions

81
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.390
of our own solar system planets.

82
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.830
And that is fascinating

83
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.070
because it means that everything that we have found so far

84
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.290
is not like the solar system.

85
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.960
So one of the open questions in exoplanets is,

86
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.110
how common are solar systems out there?

87
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.780
Are we a very unique system,

88
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.450
or we don't know yet because our techniques

89
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.810
don't allow us to see systems like ours?

90
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.950
Even James Webb,

91
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.490
with all the superb capabilities that it has,

92
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.140
is not sensitive enough

93
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.870
to detect the atmospheres of terrestrial planets.

94
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.630
And the only reason for that is that we are talking about

95
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.050
a signal that is one part in a hundred thousand

96
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.060
or one part in a million.

97
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.820
So, it's very, very small.

98
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.180
So, the next frontier in this field

99
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.910
is to be able to characterize the atmospheres

100
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.530
of planets like Earth.

101
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.290
But that is going to have to wait a little bit.

102
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.810
NASA is currently developing this new mission

103
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.930
called the Habitable Worlds Observatory,

104
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.110
and that mission is going to be like specifically designed

105
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.500
to characterize atmospheres of planets like Earth.

106
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.680
If you're a young person interested in exoplanets,

107
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.250
as I was 20 years ago, stick to it.

108
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.470
This field moves very quickly,

109
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.570
the technology moves very quickly,

110
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.820
and there's many contributions that you can do.

111
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.850
You can be an instrument builder, you can be an observer,

112
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.140
you can analyze data looking for more transiting planets.

113
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.990
You can analyze data with those transiting planets

114
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.910
looking for molecules

115
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.880
and chemical elements in the atmosphere.

116
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.820
There's a still a long way to go for us,

117
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.110
and I'm not going to do it,

118
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.430
you are going to do it.

119
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.830
So, if this is what you want to do,

120
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.408
stick to it, and it's going to be a lot of fun.

121
00:05:19.408 --> 00:05:21.991
(upbeat music)
