00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.000 line:15% 
I'm a conservation scientist

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.430 line:15% 
at the National Museum of Asian Art,

4
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.010
a part of the Smithsonian Institution.

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.900
So, there are over 2,000 jades

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.170
in the National Museum of Asian Art.

7
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.550
Jade is a hard stone that can hold a polish.

8
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.400
It is not a specific mineral group,

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.680
but it can be a term that's used

10
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.020
to cover many different types.

11
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.020
The material that's making up the jade can be important

12
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.930
for both understanding its sourcing

13
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.050
as well as how it has been handled in the past

14
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.430
as well as how to care for the future.

15
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.310
If we can do noninvasive imaging,

16
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.250
we can look often at the entirety of the object

17
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.390
as well as these are objects that are in our care,

18
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.080
and so if we can find an answer without taking a sample,

19
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.030
that's our first preference.

20
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.070
Different materials that we use for jades,

21
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.280
nephrite is the most common that we see in China.

22
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.360
Jadeite, which is probably the most thought-of jade

23
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.810
currently is not found in China.

24
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.480
Its closest location is in Southeast Asia,

25
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.400
and our collection is mostly represented by nephrite objects

26
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.120
with a very small number of other materials.

27
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.940
For jades, the best technique we have used

28
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.310
to sort through a large number of objects

29
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.530
has been shortwave infrared reflectance spectroscopy

30
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.720
from a material that we can see its reflectance spectrum,

31
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.800
and then we can compare that

32
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.440
to other known reference materials,

33
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.273
and using that,

34
00:01:35.273 --> 00:01:38.730
we can easily sort out many of the materials.

35
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.160
The first two samples are nephrite,

36
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.590
and you can see they can vary a lot in color

37
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.690
just from these two examples.

38
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.380
The next two are two serpentine stones.

39
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.970
The next two are jadeite dioxide and a talc,

40
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.230
so this is the softest one.

41
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.250
We can see scratches on it,

42
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.020
so that would be an immediate indication of

43
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.320
it's a different material,

44
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.600
so here, each line, as the camera's going through,

45
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.630
it's collecting a spectrum from this.

46
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.100
After it's done collecting,

47
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.840
we can pull up the data and investigate

48
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.190
and look at the different areas to see and compare.

49
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.470
Now we see the image.

50
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.730
It's got false colors

51
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.973
based off of the bands that are set here.

52
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.650
I can drag the spot around to look at

53
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.813
what's the spectrum from that spot?

54
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.760
So the stone here

55
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.540
and the spectrum that we see is from nephrite,

56
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.470
and that's the most common stone that we have

57
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.480
for our Chinese jades.

58
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.130
The stone is on the far left,

59
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.930
and this smaller rectangular stone are both nephrite,

60
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.420
but they have somewhat different intensities of signals

61
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.520
their spectral features are the same.

62
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.780
We can see the peaks at 1,400, 2,300,

63
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.870
and 2,400 nanometers

64
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.913
are very distinctive for nephrite,

65
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.160
and we can compare that

66
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.850
if we look over to the jadeite sample,

67
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.470
this peak is actually here has shifted over to about 1,420.

68
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.481
We have some different peaks.

69
00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:15.870
You can immediately see,

70
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.260
if I can bring up a comparison spectrum,

71
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.050
they're very different as we immediately think

72
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.723
there's a different mineral phase that's occurring,

73
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.910
and so that would lead to other investigations

74
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.253
to confirm which stone this is.

75
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.847
(upbeat music)
