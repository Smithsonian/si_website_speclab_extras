<v ->As a conservation scientist</v>

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.190 line:15% 
within the National Museum of Asian Art,

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.400
we're focused on using scientific techniques

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.170
to understand materials, how a particular artwork was made

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.280 line:15% 
and how those materials may change over time

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.710 line:15% 
and what may be done to preserve them

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.333 line:15% 
for longer periods of time.

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.300
This particular camera is a hyperspectral imaging camera

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.250
that's gonna split up infrared light

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.980
into the different wavelengths

11
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.530
and measure that on the camera sensor.

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.580
And that then can all be assembled into a cube of data later

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.320
that we can examine and interpret

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.660
to see how the object,

15
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.000
what its reflectance characteristics are,

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.610
and where those different signals are coming from.

17
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.930
We can see unique spectral features from each material,

18
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.540
and so that can tell us the materials that are present.

19
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.850
Each pigment is gonna have its own response,

20
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.100
both in how we see it in the visible light

21
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.783
as well as in the infrared light.

22
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.390
This sample is a set of pigments that was painted out.

23
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.500
It's a mix of both inorganic or organic pigments,

24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.470
and we've used this as comparison samples

25
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.600
to our actual objects.

26
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.380
Vermilion, red lead, malachite, azurite,

27
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.660
which appears as blue.

28
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.030
And indigo is down here.

29
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.610
This is a very dark paint-out of indigo.

30
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.170
So in some cases these pigments

31
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.870
may look entirely transparent in the infrared

32
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.660
and we may just see signals from the paper below it.

33
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.493
In other cases,

34
00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.270
it's gonna have distinctive spectral features

35
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.060
and we could immediately identify what pigments are there.

36
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.060
The next setup is going to be to capture the data from it.

37
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.243
So I can just essentially hit Start.

38
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.160
So the collection often can be fast

39
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.413
and the interpretation may take a long time.

40
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.740
Yeah, everything's, that's fine.

41
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.740
So that should now be essentially 600,

42
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.730
some lines of data that are then finished. It's saved,

43
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.593
so that's this object is done.

44
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.780 line:15% 
Right now we're looking at a scene from

45
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.730 line:15% 
the Japanese hand scrolls about Jizō Bosatsu

46
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.130 line:15% 
and in this scene we've identified pigments

47
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.730 line:15% 
that are present based off of the spectra that we see.

48
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.440
And so we're gonna look at those spectra

49
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.070
and then find out where those different pigments appear.

50
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.420
So I'm gonna take the information

51
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.550
that I've learned from those paint-outs

52
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.990
and apply it to uncovering what each of these curves mean.

53
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.790
This is a set of spectra.

54
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.790
At the top we have the response of a white pigment.

55
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.380
The bottom, we have a black pigment

56
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.140
that has very little signal.

57
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.240
I'm gonna focus on this green spectrum,

58
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.330
which is a copper green

59
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.330
and this purple spectrum that we can associate as indigo.

60
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.380
So we're gonna take these different spectra

61
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.270
and process all of the spectra within that data cube

62
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.100
to look for when do we see these features.

63
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.460
And we're gonna have a map that is gonna show

64
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.410
how much does this pixel match up to

65
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.520
that particular spectral feature.

66
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.370
So we've divided this up by scenes.

67
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.230
In this interior scene,

68
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.340
we can see a number of ladies-in-waiting inside

69
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.870
on these tatami mats, which appears somewhat of green.

70
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.750
And we've seen a number of areas of red

71
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.370
and some other discoloration.

72
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.260
So if we were trying to, let's say,

73
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.690
look for this copper green,

74
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.630
which we know is present based on the appearance

75
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.620
and based on other techniques

76
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.630
where we know that there's copper present.

77
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.570
We can, I have to open up a another file

78
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.520
to highlight this, 'cause it's here.

79
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.540
So what we're seeing now is everywhere where it is bright,

80
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.290
the whiter it is, the closer a match it is

81
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.950
to that copper green spectrum.

82
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.450
So in these areas where we can see these to tatami mats,

83
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.190
we can see a really strong signal

84
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.720
from that copper green,

85
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.580
more so than we might expect based on looking at it visibly.

86
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.740
The other case, the indigo that I mentioned,

87
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.380
if I was glancing at this, I might not say

88
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.480
where would the indigo go?

89
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.480
So that again, is this purple spectrum,

90
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.280
is this kind of particular inflection point

91
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.200
around 700 nanometers.

92
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.530
And if I load that spectrum,

93
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.500
where we see these bright white areas

94
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.010
is where this indigo was present.

95
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.060
So in that case,

96
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.380
it's really found at the bottom of the scroll

97
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.160
giving sort of either a watery or foggy presence

98
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.440
below this interior scene.

99
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.340
And we've actually found that

100
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.500
in a lot of different areas of the scroll.

101
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.714
Once we know it's there, we can kind of just see

102
00:05:06.714 --> 00:05:09.060
its presence, but we can also see

103
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.460
where it was lost between the fill.

104
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.050
So this is gonna be,

105
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.650
the contrast is a bit boosted now to look at.

106
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.970
One of the things we'd like to do

107
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.490
is to confirm these areas

108
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.530
where we think there is indigo

109
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.250
based off of the statistical analysis.

110
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.040
I wanna actually confirm by looking at the spectrum there.

111
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.850
So here I can pull up the spectrum

112
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.670
and see that kind of distinctive shape of the indigo.

113
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.470
So that lets me know it's there

114
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.810
and in areas where by my eye,

115
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.570
it looks like a very similar faint blue

116
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.120
in this area of damage.

117
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.740
The software doesn't see the indigo

118
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.750
and I don't see it there in the spectrum either.

119
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.580
So we're able to pull out some of this information

120
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.620
that we wouldn't otherwise note.

121
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.020
We can kind of essentially go

122
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.530
and kind of explore around the scene.

123
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.710
This can be really useful for at first glance

124
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.710
to determine how similar or different are pigment areas

125
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.750
or going through and seeing different shapes of profiles.

126
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.290
It can give us some of the pigments

127
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.720
that we wanna be on the lookout for.

128
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.330
Here we're looking at this deep red color,

129
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.270
which is the vermilion, which is a mercury sulfide

130
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.350
and has a very sharp transition that's very distinctive.

131
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.273
This is vermilion.

132
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.690
And then we also see in this pinkish area,

133
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.940
it's a vermilion mixed with the lead white,

134
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.260
which makes it brighter,

135
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.980
but we still see that very sharp transition.

136
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.370
Then in other areas we have the lead-based white,

137
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.340
which we can see its reflectance here

138
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.470
and that the palette of this scroll

139
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.210
compared to some of the other things that we look at

140
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.740
is much more limited

141
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.440
and that that's most simply the style.

142
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.980
Well, I really like that it's a field

143
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.550
where as a scientist I am also mingling with non-scientists,

144
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.620
because we each come with our own perspective.

145
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.440
Often this hyperspectral data is only one part of it.

146
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.940
We also want to put it into context.

147
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.460
So it's time where we will bring in a conservator

148
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.290
to discuss what our findings are

149
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.780
and what those might mean for the object's history

150
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.110
and to the art historian to talk about

151
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.190
what that might mean for the choices that an artist made

152
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.690
and the materials that are present

153
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.093
and what that could mean for its history.

154
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.543
(upbeat music)
